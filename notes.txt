//User Story 
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button >>>>  THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question >>>>>> THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly >>>>>> THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 >>>>>> THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over >>>>>> THEN I can save my initials and my score
